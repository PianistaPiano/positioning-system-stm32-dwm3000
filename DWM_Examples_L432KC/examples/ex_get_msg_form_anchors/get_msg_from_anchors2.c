 *  @brief   Double-sided two-way ranging (DS TWR) responder example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example which acts as the responder in a DS TWR distance measurement exchange. This application waits for a "poll"
 *           message (recording the RX time-stamp of the poll) expected from the "ds_twr_initiator_v2" example code (companion to this application), and
 *           then sends a "response" message to complete the exchange. The response message contains all the time-stamps recorded by this application,
 *           including the calculated/predicted TX time-stamp for the response message itself. The companion "DS TWR initiator" example application
 *           works out the time-of-flight over-the-air and, thus, the estimated distance between the two devices.
 *
 *           This example utilises the 802.15.4z STS to accomplish secure timestamps between the initiator and responder. A 32-bit STS counter
 *           is part of the STS IV used to generate the scrambled timestamp sequence (STS) in the transmitted packet and to cross correlate in the
 *           receiver. This count normally advances by 1 for every 1024 chips (~2�s) of STS in BPRF mode, and by 1 for every 5124 chips (~1�s) of STS
 *           in HPRF mode. If both devices (initiator and responder) have count values that are synced, then the communication between devices should
 *           result in secure timestamps which can be used to calculate distance. If not, then the devices need to re-sync their STS counter values.
 *           In this example, the initiator will send a plain-text value of it's 32-bit STS counter inside the "poll" frame. The receiver first
 *           checks the quality of the STS of the received frame. If the received frame has bad STS quality, it can then use the plain-text
 *           counter value received to adjust it's own STS counter value to match. This means that the next message in the sequence should be in sync again.

 * 2. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded typical value
 *    but, in a real application, each device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get the best possible precision when performing
 *    range measurements.
 * 3. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
 *    following:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW IC.
 * 4. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 5. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 6. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
 *    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
 *    bytes.
 * 7. As we want to send final TX timestamp in the final message, we have to compute it in advance instead of relying on the reading of DW IC
 *    register. Timestamps and delayed transmission time are both expressed in device time units so we just have to add the desired response delay to
 *    response RX timestamp to get final transmission time. The delayed transmission time resolution is 512 device time units which means that the
 *    lower 9 bits of the obtained value must be zeroed. This also allows to encode the 40-bit value in a 32-bit words by shifting the all-zero lower
 *    8 bits.
 * 8. In this operation, the high order byte of each 40-bit timestamps is discarded. This is acceptable as those time-stamps are not separated by
 *    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays (needed in the
 *    time-of-flight computation) can be handled by a 32-bit subtraction.
 * 9. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 10. When running this example on the Dw3000 eval board platform with the POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY response delay provided, the dwt_starttx() is always
 *     successful. However, in cases where the delay is too short (or something else interrupts the code flow), then the dwt_starttx() might be issued
 *     too late for the configured start time. The code below provides an example of how to handle this condition: In this case it abandons the
 *     ranging exchange and simply goes back to awaiting another poll message. If this error handling code was not here, a late dwt_starttx() would
 *     result in the code flow getting stuck waiting subsequent RX event that will will never come. The companion "initiator" example (ex_06a) should
 *     timeout from awaiting the "response" and proceed to send another poll in due course to initiate another ranging exchange.
 * 11. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
 * 12. In this example, the DW IC is put into IDLE state after calling dwt_initialise(). This means that a fast SPI rate of up to 20 MHz can be used
 *     thereafter.
 * 13. This example uses STS with a packet configuration of mode 1 which looks like so:
 *    ---------------------------------------------------
 *    | Ipatov Preamble | SFD | STS | PHR | PHY Payload |
 *    ---------------------------------------------------
 *    There is a possibility that the TX and RX units in this example will go out of sync as their STS IV values may be misaligned. The STS IV value
 *    changes upon each receiving and transmitting event by the chip. While the TX and RX devices in this example start at the same STS IV values, it
 *    is possible that they can go out sync if a signal is not received correctly, devices are out of range, etc. To combat this, the 'poll message'
 *    that the initiator sends to the responder contains a plain-text STS counter value. The responder receives this message and first checks if
 *    the received frame is out of sync with it's own counter. If so, it will use this received counter value to update it's own counter. When out
 *    of sync with each other, the STS will not align correctly - thus we get no secure timestamp values.
 * 14. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *     configuration.
 * 15. In this operation, the high order byte of each 40-bit timestamps is discarded. This is acceptable as those time-stamps are not separated by
 *     more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays (needed in the
 *     time-of-flight computation) can be handled by a 32-bit subtraction.
 * 16. This example will set the STS key and IV upon each iteration of the main while loop. While this has the benefit of keeping the STS count in
 *     sync with the responder device (which does the same), it should be noted that this is not a 'secure' implementation as the count is reset upon
 *     each iteration of the loop. An attacker could potentially recognise this pattern if the signal was being monitored. While it serves it's
 *     purpose in this simple example, it should not be utilised in any final solution.
